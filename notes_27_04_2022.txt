---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* The below SQL statement will sum up all the basics from all the rows and display */


select sum(salary) 
from employee

/* The below SQL statement will first group the departments and then calculate the sum of salary departmentwise and display
salary totals */
select sum(salary)
from employee
group by dept


/* The below SQL statement will first group the departments and then calculate the sum of salary departmentwise and display
salary totals alongwith the name of the departments */
select dept,sum(salary)
from employee
group by dept;

/* The below SQL statement is returning unique value for the designations */
SELECT dept
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept;

SELECT DISTINCT dept
FROM employee;

* Aggregate functions can be used without group by clause.
* Aggregate functions are used mostly with group by clause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HAVING clause is used to give condition after grouping the data and with having we use aggregate
functions ( sum,avg,max,min,count)
Display the count of employees departmentwise where the count of employees are more than 10.
  SELECT department,count(id)
  FROM employeedetails
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING count(id)>10
 department       count(id)
  Mkt              15
  Development      20
Display departmentwise average of basic
  SELECT department,avg(basic)
  FROM employeedetails
  GROUP BY department
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING as both seems to be used for filtering or 
restricting the rows?
A Where clause is applied while giving condition to each of the records and accordingly
 display the records whereas having is used to give condition or restriction after
 grouping the data.  
 We use where with the requirements like
 Display the records of all the managers.
 Display the records where the basic is more than 12000.
 Display the records where middlename is null.
 Display the records who joined the company in the year 2010.
 Display the records who joined the company between 2010 and 2020.
 Display the record who joined the company not betwwn 2010 and 2020.
 We use having with the requirements like
 Display the departmentwise count of employees where the count is more than 5.
 Display the departmentwise average of basic pay where the average is more than 20000.
Q Can we use where and haing in a single SQL statement?
A Yes
 Display the designationwise count for the employees from sales department  and display for 
 the designation where the count is more than 10.

 SELECT designation,count(id)
 FROM employeedetails
 WHERE department='Sales'
 GROUP BY designation
 HAVING count(id)>10;
 
* GROUP BY clause should contain all non-aggregate columns that are present in SELECT clause
  Example
    SELECT designation,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    GROUP BY designation

  In the above select statement designation is the non aggregate column and id is the aggregate
  column as we are applying aggregate function on the id.
   

   If we write the SQL statement as follows, it will be incorrect as name is not present with the
   group by clause
   SELECT designation,name,count(id)
   FROM employeedetails
   GROUP BY designation

  So the correct way of writing should be
    SELECT designation,name,count(id)
   FROM employeedetails
   GROUP BY designation,name

  /* If we dont mention a non aggregate column in the select but it can be used in group by clause */
        2   
        3
        4
   SELECT count(id)
   FROM employeedetails
   GROUP BY designation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* GROUP BY clause should be mandatory when there is a list of aggregate and non-aggregate columns in SELECT statement
The following statement will be incorrect:
SELECT designation,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever nested aggregate columns appear in the SELECT clause, GROUP BY clause should be mandatorily used.
The below statement is incorrect
SELECT MAX(AVG(basic)) 
FROM employeedetails

Depatmentwise average basic
  SELECT department,AVG(basic)
  FROM employeedetails
  GROUP BY department

  sales 120000
  mkt   230000
  hr    500000

Display the maximum average of basic pay departmentwise

   SELECT MAX(AVG(basic))
   FROM employeedetails
   GROUP BY department
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 * HAVING cannot be written without the GROUP BY clause in the query.

    SELECT department,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING count(id)>5
    
  WE cannot write
SELECT department,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    HAVING count(id)>5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Aggregate column condition(s) should always be written along with the HAVING clause and not with the WHERE clause

The following statement will be incorrect 
    SELECT department,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    WHERE count(id)>5
    GROUP BY department
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Columns from the list of the SELECT clause should not be skipped in the GROUP BY clause. However, you can add an extra non-aggregate column which is not present in the SELECT to the GROUP BY clause

   SELECT MAX(AVG(basic))
   FROM employeedetails
   GROUP BY department

    500000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* GROUP BY clause should not contain any aggregate columns
The following statement will go wrong
 SELECT department,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    GROUP BY id
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aliased name given for the column should not be used in GROUP BY clause

The following SQL is incorrect:

 SELECT department dept,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    GROUP BY dept
---------------------------------------------------------------------
HAVING clause should not contain non-aggregate columns which are not present in the GROUP BY clause

The following statement will go incorrect
 SELECT department,count(id)
    FROM employeedetails
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING count(name)>5
